# Titanic Dataset Analysis using SQL

This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset using SQL queries to derive insights and statistics about passengers onboard.


## Introduction

The Titanic dataset analysis project aims to explore and analyze the Titanic passenger data stored in an SQL database. Using SQL queries, various aspects such as passenger demographics, survival rates, fare distribution, and more are analyzed to derive meaningful insights.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- `titanic.db`: SQLite database file containing the Titanic dataset.
- `analysis_queries.sql`: SQL file with sample queries used for dataset analysis.
- `README.md`: This README file providing project information and instructions.

## Requirements

To run the project, you need:

- SQLite or any compatible SQL database management system.
- An environment supporting SQL queries (SQLite CLI, DB browser, etc.).

## Setup

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure SQLite or an SQL database management system is installed.
3. Open the `titanic.db` file using your preferred SQL client or tool.

## Usage

- Open the `titanic.db` file in your SQL client to execute queries.
- Use the `analysis_queries.sql` file as a reference for sample queries and analysis tasks.

## Queries

The `analysis_queries.sql` file contains a collection of SQL queries for conducting various analyses on the Titanic dataset. The queries cover areas such as survival rates, demographic distributions, fare analysis, and more.
